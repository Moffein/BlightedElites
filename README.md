## Blighted Elites

Adds Blighted Elites as a T2 elite in the same tier as Malachite and Celestine enemies.

They are given 2 random T1 Elite Affixes, and have 12x HP and 3.5x damage (same stats that T2 Elites have with EliteReworks).

	- Stats can be changed in the config.
		- Separate from EliteReworks.

*Just a quick mod I made to pass the time while I wait for LiT to update.*
